                        <p id ="p1">Hellooooooooooooooooooooooooo! My name is Ben McClerklin. I am a 22 year old African American male living in Chicago. I recently graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and received my Bachelors of Science in Biomedical Engineering. My favorite sports are Basketball and Track. I generally enjoy talking to my friends, listening to music or any discussion where I can learn more about different ideas or life philosophies. For instance, given the upcoming presidential election there are numerous conversations about regarding what each person has a right to have and when. I believe that everyone should have the right to some medical care without having to give an arm and leg to recieve it. Additionally, I also believe people should have a right to the living essentials i.e. food, water, sleep and shelter. These are just some of the ideas I enjoy conversing about and hearing differeing opinions.

            <p id="p1">When I am not working or talking to my wonderful girlfriend, I have different amount of hobbies that I work on. Mostly, I play video games. Currently playing through the Dragon Age series and I am excited for Animal Crossing to come out in March. I also am a Dungeon Master for a Dungeons and Dragons group that I play with my friends. Role playing is something I have been interested in a while so its nice to have a hobby to safely try it out.</p>
            <p id="p1">This is just a small showing of who I am. If you ever see me I am friendly so feel free to say hi.</p>
