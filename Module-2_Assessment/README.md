# Ben-McClerklin-prework
Hello! This Project was created by Ben McClerklin. This read me will explain what the project does and answer some general questions.

What does this project do?
    This project is a Kingdom Hearts style hangman game. The user runs the game and tries to guess what the hidden word is by pressing one letter at a time. The user has ten guesses to get the word correctly or they will lose. A picture and audio cue are added to help the user guess what the word is.

Why is this project useful?
    This project will be used for the employers at Dev10 to evaluate my coding ability as well as my ability to learn coding practices. Additionally, this code is useful for showing fundamental use of HTML/CSS and javascript. 

How can users get started with the project?
    Pretty simple. The users can run the code by downloading the files from the linked github repository. From there the user only needs to run the index.html file in their preferred browser. Lastly, the user simply presses a key and the game will commence from there.

Where can users get help with this project?
    Users can get help with this project by contacting me at mcclerklinben@gmail.com. Otherwise users are welcome to use the internet to modify this code in any way they see fit.

Who maintains and contributes to the project?
    Ben McClerklin currently maintains and is the sole contributor of this project. Google was used as well to help find the way in which certain html elements should be used.
